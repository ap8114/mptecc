            User Experience (UX) Design is a multifaceted discipline that
            encompasses a wide range of practices aimed at creating seamless and
            intuitive interactions between users and digital products.

            Once user insights are gathered, UX designers employ techniques such
            as information architecture and wireframing to create a clear and
            organized structure for the digital product. Information architecture
            involves organizing content and functionality in a logical and
            hierarchical manner, while wireframing allows designers to sketch out
            the basic layout and structure of each screen or page.
