          Once user insights are gathered, UX designers employ techniques such
          as information architecture and wireframing to create a clear and
          organized structure for the digital product. Information architecture
          involves organizing content and functionality in a logical and
          hierarchical manner, while wireframing allows designers to sketch out
          the basic layout and structure of each screen or page.
